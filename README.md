# Kali-SSH-Login-Demo
This lab demonstrates how to establish secure remote access to a Kali Linux machine from a Windows 10 client using SSH (Secure Shell). It’s part of my broader networking and cybersecurity learning series aimed at understanding secure communication protocols and remote administration.

## 🛠️ What I Did

🔹 Installed and configured `OpenSSH Server` on Kali Linux  
🔹 Created a test folder and file on the Kali desktop for demo purposes  
🔹 Used **PuTTY** on Windows 10 to establish a secure SSH session  
🔹 Navigated the Kali filesystem from the client to verify access

## 📂 Project Files

All screenshots, notes, and walkthroughs are included in this repository under the `Images/` folder. This lab complements my [FTP + Wireshark demo](https://lnkd.in/dnjWZdYK), which demonstrated the risks of insecure communication.

## 💡 Key Takeaway

Secure protocols like SSH are essential for remote administration. This lab highlights the simplicity and power of SSH—and why it’s a far better option than legacy protocols like Telnet or FTP.

## 📬 Coming Soon

🔥 The **FTP + Wireshark sniffing lab** was just the beginning. This SSH lab builds on that concept—next up, I’ll be diving into **Azure Labs** to explore real-world cloud infrastructure setups and security practices.
